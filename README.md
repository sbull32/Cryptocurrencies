# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18

## Overview
Use various unsupervised machine learning models to classify cryptocurrencies that are currently on the market in order to better understand cryptocurrencies as a potential investment opportunity. 

## Results
After cleaning the cryptocurrency data and putting it through our machine learning models, we were able to determine that there were 532 tradable cryptocurrencies. Once we determine the cryptocurrencies we were working with, we used an elbow curve to help determine what the correct amount of clusters should be.

Finally we plotted our results on scatter plots to help visualize the data we had gone through

## Summary
We were able to determine that the 532 tradable cryptocurrencies are best suited to be classified into 3 groups for our investors. Below is the graph of the scaled data with all three of the classes included.
